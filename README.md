This repo uses YOLOV10 to identify weeds and lettuce using bounding boxes or semantic segmentation.

## Install Instructions

If your package requires certain packages that need to be downloaded, add instructions on how to do so here.  
You can embedd terminal commands in markdown like this:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Methodology

This is where you can do in-depth about how this repo works. Think of this section as writing a project report for a class.  
_Note: Markdown supports LaTex, so you can use it to embedd equations_

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

If there are common errors that might occur when running your project, you can mention how to solve them here.
